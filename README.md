# rest-example

The is the first stage of my experiment, where I try out staticly compiled
languages for simple every day job. My project will implement a simple REST
server and a client.

# Preparation

For haskell development you only need stack (advanced cargo), but be careful
and read the doc of the version of the installed library.

# Result

My discoveries are collected in the commit message of the project.

# Conclusion

## Pros

The typesystem is a bless but this lead as extra legwork to understand other
libraries, which may not fit for smaller projects simple applications where you
have to dif in the technical deatiles not the library implementations, however
you find good libraries for lots of problems because the language is quite
mature.

## Cons

The overusage of operators makes it hard for beginners to understand a library,
and the cheap abstraction is the bases of overengineering a tool.
